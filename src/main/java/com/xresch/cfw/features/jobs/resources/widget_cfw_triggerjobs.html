<p>This widget allows you to specify a list of jobs that can be started and stopped from
the dashboard they are displayed on.</p>

<p>All users that have access to the dashboard can start and stop the jobs.
The users editing the widget can only select jobs he has access too.</p>

<p>The widget auto refreshes all 30 seconds to see if jobs are still running. This widget 
will disable itself on public dashboards.</p>

<p>To only trigger jobs manually, set a schedule with a start time far in the future.</p>
