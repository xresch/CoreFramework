<p>With the CoreFramework version 1.0.0 and later, you can extend your application.</br>
With the new version, CFW is delivered as a .jar-File that will be used to host and run an application that can be placed in the folder "./extensions".
Additional extensions can be written and placed in the same folder as described here.</p>

<h2>Example Project</h2>
<p>You can find an example project in the following GitHub repository: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xresch/CoreFramework_ExtensionExample">CoreFramework_ExtensionExample</a></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The mechanism is quite simple. You can write your application as before, except that you need to add annotations to your application class and your features.
Here is an example of the annotations: </p>

<pre>
<code>/***************************************************************
 * Use @CFWExtensionApplication to mark a class implementing 
 * CFWAppInterface that should be loaded on server startup.
 * If @CFWExtensionApplication is found multiple times on the 
 * classpath, only the first one is used.
 * Do not use this if you are extending an existing application.
 **************************************************************/
@CFWExtensionApplication
public class ExampleExtensionApplication implements CFWAppInterface {
	...
}

/***************************************************************
 * Use @CFWExtensionFeature to mark a class extending 
 * CFWAppFeature that should be loaded on server startup.
 * The features marked with @CFWExtensionFeature are loaded after
 * all features registered with CFW.Registry.Features.addFeature().
 * The order is not predictable, except you create a feature that
 * registers other features with above method.
 **************************************************************/
@CFWExtensionFeature
public class FeatureExtensionTest extends CFWAppFeature {
	...
}</code>
</pre>


<h2>Building the Extensions</h2>
<p>When you build your extension, include all your class files but exclude the CFW dependencies.
Copy your extension.jar file and any additional dependencies to:</p>

<pre>
<code>{APP_ROOT}/extensions</code>
</pre>

<h2>Testing during Development</h2>
<p>To test your extension during development, you can create a small main method like the following to run the CFW server with your extension: </p>

<pre>
<code>package com.xresch.cfw.example.main;

import com.xresch.cfw._main.CFW;
import com.xresch.cfw._main.CFWAppInterface;

public class _MainForTesting {
			
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception
    {
    	//------------------------------------
    	// Load application Extension
    	CFWAppInterface app = CFW.loadExtentionApplication();

    	//------------------------------------
    	// Start Application
    	CFW.initializeApp(app, args);
    }
}</code>
</pre>
