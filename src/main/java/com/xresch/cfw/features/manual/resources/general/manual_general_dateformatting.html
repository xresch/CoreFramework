<p>When formatting time, there are two different styles: client side and server side formatting. </p>

<h2>Server-Side</h2>
<p>The server-side formatting is based on the DateTimeFormatter class of Java. Following the parts of the java documentation explaining the patterns.
</p>
<h2>Patterns for Formatting and Parsing</h2>
<p> (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html">source</a>, adjusted where necessary)</p>
<p>
Patterns are based on a simple sequence of letters and symbols. 
For example, "d MMM uuuu" will format 2011-12-03 as '3 Dec 2011'.
</p>
<p>
All letters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z' are reserved as pattern letters. The
following pattern letters are defined:

<p>
The count of pattern letters determines the format.
<p>
<b>Text</b>: The text style is determined based on the number of pattern
letters used. Less than 4 pattern letters will use the
short form(e.g 'Mon' for Monday). Exactly 4 pattern letters will use the
full form(e.g 'Monday'). Exactly 5 pattern letters will use the
narrow form(e.g 'M' for Monday).
Pattern letters 'L', 'c', and 'q' specify the stand-alone form of the text styles.
<p>
<b>Number</b>: If the count of letters is one, then the value is output using
the minimum number of digits and without padding. Otherwise, the count of digits
is used as the width of the output field, with the value zero-padded as necessary.
The following pattern letters have constraints on the count of letters.
Only one letter of 'c' and 'F' can be specified.
Up to two letters of 'd', 'H', 'h', 'K', 'k', 'm', and 's' can be specified.
Up to three letters of 'D' can be specified.
<p>
<b>Number/Text</b>: If the count of pattern letters is 3 or greater, use the
Text rules above. Otherwise use the Number rules above.
<p>
<b>Fraction</b>: Outputs the nano-of-second field as a fraction-of-second.
The nano-of-second value has nine digits, thus the count of pattern letters
is from 1 to 9. If it is less than 9, then the nano-of-second value is
truncated, with only the most significant digits being output.
<p>
<b>Year</b>: The count of letters determines the minimum field width below
which padding is used. If the count of letters is two, then a
{@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#appendValueReduced reduced} two digit form is
used. For printing, this outputs the rightmost two digits. For parsing, this
will parse using the base value of 2000, resulting in a year within the range
2000 to 2099 inclusive. If the count of letters is less than four (but not
two), then the sign is only output for negative years. Otherwise, the sign is 
output if the pad width is exceeded.
<p>
<b>ZoneId</b>: This outputs the time-zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'. If the
count of letters is two, then the time-zone ID is output. Any other count of
letters throws IllegalArgumentException.
<p>
<b>Zone names</b>: This outputs the display name of the time-zone ID. If the
count of letters is one, two or three, then the short name is output. If the
count of letters is four, then the full name is output. Five or more letters
throws IllegalArgumentException.
<p>
<b>Offset X and x</b>: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern
letters. One letter outputs just the hour, such as '+01', unless the minute
is non-zero in which case the minute is also output, such as '+0130'. Two
letters outputs the hour and minute, without a colon, such as '+0130'. Three
letters outputs the hour and minute, with a colon, such as '+01:30'. Four
letters outputs the hour and minute and optional second, without a colon,
such as '+013015'. Five letters outputs the hour and minute and optional
second, with a colon, such as '+01:30:15'. Six or more letters throws
IllegalArgumentException. Pattern letter 'X' (upper case) will output
'Z' when the offset to be output would be zero, whereas pattern letter 'x'
(lower case) will output '+00', '+0000', or '+00:00'.
<p>
<b>Offset O</b>: This formats the localized offset based on the number of
pattern letters. One letter outputs the short form of the localized offset, 
which is localized offset text, such as 'GMT',
with hour without leading zero, optional 2-digit minute and second if
non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+8'. Four letters outputs the
full form, which is localized offset text, such as 'GMT, with 2-digit hour and 
minute field, optional second field if non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+08:00'. 
Any other count of letters throws IllegalArgumentException.
<p>
<b>Offset Z</b>: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern
letters. One, two or three letters outputs the hour and minute, without a
colon, such as '+0130'. The output will be '+0000' when the offset is zero.
Four letters outputs the full form of localized
offset, equivalent to four letters of Offset-O. The output will be the
corresponding localized offset text if the offset is zero. Five
letters outputs the hour, minute, with optional second if non-zero, with
colon. It outputs 'Z' if the offset is zero.
Six or more letters throws IllegalArgumentException.
<p>
<b>Optional section</b>: The optional section markers work exactly like
calling DateTimeFormatterBuilder.optionalStart() and
DateTimeFormatterBuilder.optionalEnd().
<p>
<b>Pad modifier</b>: Modifies the pattern that immediately follows to be
padded with spaces. The pad width is determined by the number of pattern
letters. This is the same as calling DateTimeFormatterBuilder.padNext(int).
<p>
For example, 'ppH' outputs the hour-of-day padded on the left with spaces to
a width of 2.
<p>
Any unrecognized letter is an error. Any non-letter character, other than
'[', ']', '{', '}', '#' and the single quote will be output directly.
Despite this, it is recommended to use single quotes around all characters
that you want to output directly to ensure that future changes do not break
your application.
