<p>With the CoreFramework version 1.0.0 and later, you can extend your application.</br>
With the new version, CFW is delivered as a .jar-File that will be used to host and run an application that can be placed in the folder "./extensions".
Additional extensions can be written and placed in the same folder as described here.</p>

<h2>Example Project</h2>
<p>You can find an example project in the following GitHub repository: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/xresch/CoreFramework_ExtensionExample">CoreFramework_ExtensionExample</a></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The mechanism is quite simple. You can write your application as before, except that you need to add a service definition to the META-INF directory. </p>

<p>Sample service definition for application:</p>
<pre>
<code>// example path for maven projects. Filename is the fully-qualified class name of the implemented interface.
/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.xresch.cfw.spi.CFWAppInterface

// File content example, fully-qualified class name of your implementation
// you can only have one application loaded, if multiple are defined the first will be loaded, all others are ignored.
com.xresch.cfw.example._main.ExampleExtensionApplication
 </code>
</pre>

<p>Sample service definition for features:</p>
<pre>
<code>// example path for maven projects. Filename is the fully-qualified class name of the implemented interface.
/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.xresch.cfw.spi.CFWAppFeature

// File content example, fully-qualified class name of your implementation, one class name per line:
com.xresch.cfw.example._main.ExampleExtentionFeature
 </code>
</pre>

<h2>Building the Extensions</h2>
<p>When you build your extension, include all your class files but exclude the CFW dependencies.
Copy your extension.jar file and any additional dependencies to:</p>

<pre>
<code>{APP_ROOT}/extensions</code>
</pre>

<h2>Testing during Development</h2>
<p>To test your extension during development, you can create a small main method like the following to run the CFW server with your extension: </p>

<pre>
<code>package com.xresch.cfw.example.main;

import com.xresch.cfw._main.CFW;
import com.xresch.cfw._main.CFWAppInterface;

public class _MainForTesting {
			
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception
    {
    	//------------------------------------
    	// Load application Extension
    	CFWAppInterface app = CFW.loadExtensionApplication();

    	//------------------------------------
    	// Start Application
    	CFW.initializeApp(app, args);
    }
}</code>
</pre>
