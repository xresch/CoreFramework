<p>
The following is a general setup guide for applications using the Core Framework(CFW).
Depending on the application there might be additional steps needed to make the system fully functional.
</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Java:&nbsp;</strong>JDK 1.8 or higher. JRE is not enough, The H2 database needs the javac executable on the classpath to be able to compile database procedures.</li>
	<li><strong>OS:&nbsp;</strong>Operating systems that support Java. Some applications might have limited support for operating systems.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity:&nbsp;</strong>Depends on the implementations used and the load on the system, a minimum of 4GB RAM and 4 x 1.6 GHz Cores is recommended.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Setup Guide</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Install JDK:&nbsp;</strong>Install JDK 1.8 or higher. The /bin-Folder has to be added to the PATH environment variable so that the javac executable can be found.</li>
	<li><strong>Download:&nbsp;</strong>Get the .zip-File with the application binaries.</li>
	<li><strong>Unzip:&nbsp;</strong>Unzip the files to the folder where the application should be located.</li>
	<li><strong>Configuration:&nbsp;</strong>Open ./config/cfw.properties and adjust the properties to fit your needs.</li>
	<li><strong>Start:&nbsp;</strong>Start the application using the start script in the root folder.</li>
	<li><strong>Default Login:&nbsp;</strong>Use http://localhost:{port}/ to access the application. Use the default user 'admin' with password 'admin'.</li>
	<li><strong>Change Default Password:&nbsp;</strong>Change the default password of the admin user using &quot;Menu Bar &gt;&gt; Username &gt;&gt; Change Password&quot;.</li>
	<li><strong>Configuration(Optional):&nbsp;</strong>Go to  &quot;Menu Bar &gt;&gt; Admin &gt;&gt; Configuration&quot; to adjust the configuration of your application.</li>
	<li><strong>Context Settings(Optional):&nbsp;</strong>If your application provides Context Settings, you might need to add such settings before you can make use of certain features. Go to  &quot;Menubar &gt;&gt; Admin &gt;&gt; Context Settings&quot; to add context settings for your needs.</li>
	<li><strong>Restart:&nbsp;</strong>Stop the application, delete the log files, start the application to see if restarts properly and no major issues are present in the logs.</li>
	<li><strong>System Startup:&nbsp;</strong>Add the application to your system startup to make sure it runs after the machine gets restarted.</li>
	<li><strong>Manual:&nbsp;</strong>After your application is running you can access the other manual pages directly in the application under &quot;Menu Bar &gt;&gt; Manual&quot;.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Setup Guides:&nbsp;</strong>The application built on the Core Framework might ship with additional setup steps you might want to follow.</li>

	<li><strong>Activate Features(Optional):&nbsp;</strong>Go to &quot;Menu Bar &gt;&gt; Admin &gt;&gt; Feature Management&quot; and activate any deactivated features you want to have enabled. Restart the application to have the changes applied.</li>
	<li><strong>Configuration(Optional):&nbsp;</strong>Go to  &quot;Menu Bar &gt;&gt; Admin &gt;&gt; Configuration&quot; to adjust the configuration of your application.</li>
	<li><strong>Context Settings(Optional):&nbsp;</strong>If your application provides Context Settings, you might need to add such settings before you can make use of certain features. Go to  &quot;Menubar &gt;&gt; Admin &gt;&gt; Context Settings&quot; to add context settings for your needs.</li>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Here some tips for troubleshooting the application:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Log Files:&nbsp;</strong>Check the log files for WARNING or SEVERE messages.</li>
	<li><strong>More Logs:&nbsp;</strong>To get more detailed logs, adjust the log level in ./config/logging.properties, which is a confugration file for java.util.logging.</li>
	<li><strong>CPU Sampling:&nbsp;</strong>If you have performance issues, you can use &quot;Menu Bar &gt;&gt; Admin &gt;&gt; System Analytics &gt;&gt; CPU Sampling&quot; to get insights into what methods consume the most time in the application.</li>
	<li><strong>DB Statistics:&nbsp;</strong>You can see soem Database statistics under &quot;Menu Bar &gt;&gt; Admin &gt;&gt; System Analytics &gt;&gt; DB Analytics&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>JVM Bind Exception:&nbsp;</strong>This issue is either caused by the ports defined in ./config/cfw.properties are already in use or are not available for other reasons.</li>
	<li><strong>JavaC / DB Procedure not found:&nbsp;</strong> H2 procedures need the javac executable in the PATH system variable in order to be compiled. Check if the javac is available from the command line by executing the command 'javac.exe' for windows or 'javac' for linux.</li>
</ul>
