<p>Automated Certificate Management Environment(ACME) is used to automatically fetch certificates from a Certificate Authority(CA).
In case of this application, this is used for SSL certificates used for making HTTPS connections secure.</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>Following are some details how it works in this application. Example settings you will find in the next section.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Port 80:&nbsp;</b>Must be open and set in the cfw.properties as the HTTP port. The Certificate Authority will send requests to the application using this port.</li>
	<li><b>Location:&nbsp;</b>The keys and keystore-file will be saved to a folder specified by the property 'cfw_https_acme_folder'. </li>
	<li><b>Startup:&nbsp;</b>The application will check on startup if certificates are out-dated and have to be renewed.</li>
	<li><b>Restart:&nbsp;</b>After certificates have been renewed, a restart is required for them to be properly loaded.</li>
	<li><b>Renewal Checks:&nbsp;</b>Will be executed every 4 hours at the time of the application startup.</li>
	<li><b>Browser Warnings:&nbsp;</b>Your browsers might still show a warning for a while after a successful update of certificates. Check in an incognito window if it works. </li>
</ul>
