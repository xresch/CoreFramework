<h3>Admin Default Credentials</h3>
<p> The default credentials of the application are username "admin" with password "admin". To have a secure application, you need to change the default password.</p>


<h3>Disabled Authentication - Use Anonymous</h3>
<p>You can operate the application without any login and disable authentication entirely. 
Everyone accessing the application will operate as the user "anonymous", which is by default a Superuser that can do anything.
This can be useful as a playground setup.
Set the following property to false in /config/cfw.properties:</p>
<pre><code>cfw_authentication_enabled=false</code></pre>


<h3>Database Authentication</h3>
<p>Database authentication is the default authentication of the application and is also used as fallback for other authentication methods like CSV or LDAP.
Users can be created by admin users in the application that are stored in the database. 
As the credentials of those users are stored in the DB, they will always be able to login even when foreign authentication is unavailable(CSV, LDAP, SSO ...).
This setup is useful if you just want to run the application without the effort of installing other software(like an Active Directory).
It is also useful to create system accounts.
Set the following property to "DB" in /config/cfw.properties:</p>
<pre><code>authentication_method=DB</code></pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> Users from other sources(CSV, LDAP, SSO...) are still created in the database with the property "is Foreign = true".
They show up in the database but will not be able to authenticate against the DB.</p>


<h3>CSV Authentication</h3>
<p>You can define username/password combinations in the file /config/credentials.csv, which can then be used to login into the application.
This can be useful for demo purposes. The users will be added to the Database and can be further edited with the admin user.
Set the following property to "CSV" in /config/cfw.properties:</p>
<pre><code>authentication_method=CSV</code></pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> The database will still be used as fallback. If a user is not found in the CSV file, the application will check for the username or email in the database.
If there is a matching user, the login will check the credentials stored in the database.(passwords from CSV file are not stored in DB)</p>


<h3>LDAP Authentication</h3>
<p>LDAP Authentication allows you to connect your application to an Active Directory and let your users authenticate with they AD credentials.
Set the following properties in /config/cfw.properties:</p>
<pre><code>authentication_method=LDAP
#Adjust the properties starting with 'authentication_ldap_*' to fit your needs
authentication_ldap_*</code></pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> The database will still be used as fallback. If a user is not found in the CSV file, the application will check for the username or email in the database.
If there is a matching user, the login will check the credentials stored in the database.(passwords from LDAP are not stored in DB)</p>


<h3>OpenID Connect Provider</h3>
<p>The implementation uses Authorization Code Grant Flow with PKCE. A public client has to be used when setting up the provider.
The redirect URL of your application is https://&lt;yourserver:port&gt;/sso/callback/openidconnect.</p>


<h4>OpenID Connect with ADFS</h4>
<p>To setup SSO with ADFS do the following. Some ADFS setups are known to return &quot;invalid_grant&quot; errors.   
If this is the case for you, try using another SSO connection like SAML.
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Open ADFS:&nbsp;</strong>Connect to your ADFS Server and open the AD FS Management Tool.</li>
	<li><strong>Add Application Group:&nbsp;</strong>Right Click 'Application Groups' and choose 'Add Application Group...'.</li>
	<li><strong>Web Access:&nbsp;</strong>Enter a Name and choose &quot;Web Browser accessing a web application&quot;. Click Next.</li>
	<li><strong>Redirect URI:&nbsp;</strong>Add the redirect URI:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Template:&nbsp;</strong>https://&lt;yourserver:port&gt;/sso/callback/openidconnect</li>
			<li><strong>&lt;yourserver:port&gt;:&nbsp;</strong>Replace with servername and port as used by the end user.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Copy Client ID:&nbsp;</strong>Copy the ClientID that you see on this section of the wizard. You will need it later in the setup.</li>
	<li><strong>Access Control Policy:&nbsp;</strong>Choose the access control policy you want to set. Click Next and complete this wizard.</li>
	<li><strong>Client Permissions:&nbsp;</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Double Click the application group you have created.</li>
			<li>Double click the web application in the list.</li>
			<li>Change to the tab &quot;Client Permissions&quot;.</li>
			<li>Select the scopes 'openid, profile, email, allatclaims' and click 'Apply'.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Issuance Transform Rules:&nbsp;</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Change to the tab &quot;Issuance Transform Rules&quot; and click 'Add Rule...'.</li>
			<li>Choose &quot;Send LDAP Attributes as Claims&quot; and click Next.</li>
			<li>Add a name, choose the attribute store and add the following mappings:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>User-Principal-Name:&nbsp;</strong>upn</li>
					<li><strong>Email-Addresses:&nbsp;</strong>email</li>
					<li><strong>Given-Name:&nbsp;</strong>given_name</li>
					<li><strong>Surename:&nbsp;</strong>family_name</li>
					
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Click 'Finish'.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Open EMP:&nbsp;</strong>Open EMP and go to &quot;Menu &gt;&gt; Admin &gt;&gt; Context Settings&quot;.</li>
	<li><strong>Add Provider:&nbsp;</strong>Click on &quot;Add &gt;&gt; OpenID Connect Provider&quot; to add a new provider.</li>
	<li><strong>Required Settings for the Provider:&nbsp;</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name:&nbsp;</strong>Name for this SSO Connection. Will be added as a button in the login page.</li>
			<li><strong>Well Known Path:&nbsp;</strong>URL to the well-known config of your server.(e.g. https://acme.youradfsserver.com/adfs/.well-known/openid-configuration)</li>
			<li><strong>Client ID:&nbsp;</strong>The Client ID that you copied in a previous step. You can retrieve this from the properties of your application.</li>
			<li><strong>Resource:&nbsp;</strong>By default this is also the ClientID. You can find this under &quot;Your Application Group &gt;&gt; Web Application &gt;&gt; Identifiers &gt;&gt; Relying Party Identifiers&quot;.</li>
			<li><strong>Additional Scope:&nbsp;</strong> Enter &quot;allatclaims&quot;.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Finish Setup:&nbsp;</strong>Click on &quot;Add&quot; to add the new provider.</li>
	<li><strong>Test:&nbsp;</strong>Open a new incognito window in your browser, open the start page and check if a single-sign-on button is present. Test the login by using the button.</li>
