<p>
Used to copy the contents of a widget from another dashboard. Cannot be used to copy another Replica widget.
This can be useful if you want to show the same widget on multiple dashboards and manage it in a central place. 
Another use case is to enable users to add information to a dashboard(e.g. with a HTML Editor Widget), 
but should not be able to edit the dashboard displaying the data.
