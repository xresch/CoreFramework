<h2>Text</h2>
<p>
The text widget can be used to add simple plain text descriptions to a dashboard.
</p>


<h2>Label</h2>
<p>
The label widget is useful to create headers and vertical labeling for a row of widgets.
You can add a link to the label that is opened in a new window when the label is clicked.
If you change the labels background color, you can also make a button like widget. 
</p>

<h2>List</h2>
<p>
With the list widget you can add a ordered or unordered list of items.
</p>

<h2>Checklist</h2>
<p>
The checklist widget will add a list with checkboxes. The checkboxes can be selected and deselected even when you are not in edit mode.
</p>

<h2>CSV Table</h2>
<p>
This widget allows you to take comma separated values and display them as a table.
</p>

<h2>Image</h2>
<p>
Take the image widget and add an image with a URL to your application.
</p>

<h2>HTML Editor</h2>
<p>
Create your own HTML Content using this widget.
</p>

<h2>Website</h2>
<p>
Show another website on your dashboard. This will only work when the website you want to integrate on the dashboard allows it.
</p>

<h2>Youtube Video</h2>
<p>
Add a Youtube video to your dashboard.
</p>

<h2>Refresh Time</h2>
<p>
Adds a digital watch to your dashboard to show the last time when the dashboard was updated.
</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>
Allows to display parameters of the dashboard as input fields for the dashboard user.
The user can change the parameters to adjust the data the dashboard displays to his needs.
</p>

<h2>Replica</h2>
<p>
Used to copy the contents of a widget from another dashboard. Cannot be used to copy another Replica widget.
This can be useful if you want to show the same widget on multiple dashboards and manage it in a central place. 
Another use case is to enable users to add information to a dashboard(e.g. with a HTML Editor Widget), 
but should not be able to edit the dashboard displaying the data.
