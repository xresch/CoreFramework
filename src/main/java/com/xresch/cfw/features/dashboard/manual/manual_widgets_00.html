<h2>Adding Widgets</h2>
<p>
To add widgets to a dashboard do the following:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Open Dashboard:&nbsp;</strong> Open the dashboard you have created by clicking the view button.</li>
	<li><strong>Click Edit:&nbsp;</strong> Click the "Edit" button that you can find right after the dashboard title. The "Add Widget" button will appear and the "Edit" button will be replaced by a "Done" button.</li>
	<li><strong>Add Widget:&nbsp;</strong> Click "Add Widget" and choose a widget from the dropdown to add it to the dashboard. The widget will be added with default contents.</li>
	<li><strong>Adjust Widget:&nbsp;</strong> To change your widget, click the small gear icon in the top right corner of the widget while in edit mode.</li>
	<li><strong>Saving:&nbsp;</strong> All changes to the widgets are saved to the database implicitly. When you are done and you want to leave the dashboard, click the Done button.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
The widgets that you can add to the dashboard have settings to customize them.
When you are in edit mode, all the widgets will have a small gear icon on the top right corner.
Click on the gear and choose &quot;Edit&quot; to open the settings for the widget. 
The settings panel consists in most cases of three parts:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>A short description of the widget and how to use it.</li>
	<li><strong>Widget Settings:&nbsp;</strong>The settings which are specific to this type of the widget. For some widgets there are no settings and this part will not be available.</li>
	<li><strong>Widget Default Settings:&nbsp;</strong>The settings that are common and shared by all of the widgets.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are working with widgets settings:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Field Details:&nbsp;</strong> Most fields have a small info icon on the left side. Hover with your mouse on the icon to get some explanation about the field.</li>
	<li><strong>Two Save Buttons:&nbsp;</strong> There are two save buttons, one of each section of the settings. Please keep in mind that clicking Save will only by applied for the section you are saving.</li>
	<li><strong>Default Title:&nbsp;</strong> Most of the widgets will have a default title, which is the same as the name of the widget. To remove it make the title field blank.</li>
	<li><strong>Add Links:&nbsp;</strong> Use the Label Widget to add links to other applications. By changing the widgets color, you can make it look like a button.</li>
	<li><strong>Adding Custom HTML:&nbsp;</strong> Administrators with the permission "Allow HTML" and/or "Allow Javascript", can add custom HTML/Javascript to the title/footer field to add custom content to the widgets. (This will be overwritten if somebody without the mentioned permissions will edit and save the widget.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here an example of the settings panel for a Label Widget:</p>
