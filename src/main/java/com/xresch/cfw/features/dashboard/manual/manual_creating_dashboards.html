<h2>The Dashboard List</h2>
<p>
The dashboard list shows all your own dashboard and dashboards from other users you have access to.
Here you can create and manage dashboards. Depending on the rights you have, you have more or less possibilities:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Dashboard Viewer:&nbsp;</strong> Can view dashboards that other users have shared. Cannot create dashboards, but might edit when allowed by a dashboard creator. (Tab: Shared Dashboards)</li>
	<li><strong>Dashboard Creator:&nbsp;</strong> View, Edit and Delete all dashboards of all users, regardless of the share settings of the dashboards. (Tab: Manage Dashboards)</li>
	<li><strong>Dashboard Admin:&nbsp;</strong> Can view and create dashboards and share them with other users. (Tab: Manage Dashboards)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For each dashboard in the list you can have the following actions(Dashboard Viewers only have the View action):
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>View:&nbsp;</strong> Opens the dashboard.</li>
	<li><strong>Edit:&nbsp;</strong> Edit the dashboard settings. For editing the dashboard contents, use the Edit button on the dashboard itself.</li>
	<li><strong>Duplicate:&nbsp;</strong> Creates a copy of the dashboard and saves it to your own dashboards. Will reset the share settings of the dashboard and make it "private".</li>
	<li><strong>Delete:&nbsp;</strong> Permanently deletes a dashboard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dashboard Settings</h2>
<p>
By clicking on the edit button the Dashboard settings will open.
You can provide a name and a description for the dashboard, as well as define how you want to share the dashboard. When sharing a dashboard please consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Share with All:&nbsp;</strong> When you set "Is Shared" to true, it will be shared with all users by default.</li>
	<li><strong>Share with specific Users:&nbsp;</strong> "Is Shared" has to be true, and at least one user has to be chosen for "Shared with Users" to change the scope from "All Users" to the ones you specify.</li>
	<li><strong>Editors:&nbsp;</strong> Users specified as "Editors" can always access the dashboard, regardless if "Is Shared" is true or false. These users can change the dashboard content but not these settings itself.</li>
</ul>
