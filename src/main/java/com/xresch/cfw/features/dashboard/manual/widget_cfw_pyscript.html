<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This widget allows you to add a &lt;py-script&gt;-tag to a dashboard used by pyscript.js.
You can use multiple of this widget per dashboard.
</p>

<p>The following should be considered when using this widget:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Client Needs Internet:&nbsp;</b> The client that opens the dashboard must be able to access the world wide web. If there are restrictions he might not be able to download the necessary python libraries.</li>
	<li><b>Loading Time:&nbsp;</b> This widget adds several seconds of loading time to the dashboard for downloading pyscript resources. This might block user input during that time.</li>
	<li><b>Dev Tools Debugging:&nbsp;</b> Use the developer tools and it's console for debugging. Most of the pyscript-errors are hidden on the UI to not disrupt the UI.</li>
	<li><b>Not Everything Works:&nbsp;</b> Not everything will work, so if you run into something that does not work, work around it.</li>
	<li><b>No Endless Loops:&nbsp;</b> Do not create endless loops inside of your python code. This would start stacking if the auto refresh of the dashboard is used.</li>
	<li><b>JS Document:&nbsp;</b> The document object is already imported with &quot;from js import document&quot;. </li>
	<li><b>Constant targetID:&nbsp;</b> A constant named &quot;targetID&quot; is provided that contains the id-attribute value of the widget content div.</li>
	<li><b>Constant widget:&nbsp;</b> A constant named &quot;widget&quot; is provided that contains the DOM element. Use it to set the widget contents with &quot;widget.innerHTML&quot;. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Prepended to Every Script</h2>
<p>To make your life easier and allow you to add content to the pyscript widget, the following code is prepended to the code define in the widget:</p>
<pre><code>from js import document
targetID = "{targetID}" # {targetID} will be the id of the DOM element inside of the widget, which will receive your content
widget = document.querySelector("#"+targetID);  # the DOM element, used to set the content of the widget</code></pre>



<h2>Example Script</h2>
<p>Here is an example script:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime as dt

def createHTML(title):
	# Never use endless loops, as they will stack when widgets are refreshed
	#while True:
	
	htmlString = "&lt;span>&lt;b>"+title+"&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;br>";
	
	timestamp = dt.now().strftime("%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S")	   
	if timestamp[-1] in ["0", "2", "4", "6", "8"]:
		htmlString += '&lt;p class="bg-cfw-green text-white">It\'s time for Tiramisu!&lt;/p>';
	else:
		htmlString += timestamp
	
	return htmlString;


widgetContent = createHTML("What time is it?")
widgetContent += createHTML("Any other information?")

# use "widget" with DOM attributes to add content to the widget
widget.innerHTML = widgetContent;</code></pre>
