<p>
The checklist widget will add a list with checkboxes. 
You can add new items with the plus sign, edit by double clicking an item and remove checked items clicking the 'x'.
The checklist can be modified by users that have editor rights on the dashboard, even when not in edit mode.
When this widget is replicated using the Replica Widget, changes to the Replica will not work. Therefore it is recommended to not replicate or to put a note on the replica.
