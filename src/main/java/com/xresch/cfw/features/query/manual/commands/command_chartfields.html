<p>This command lets you render the values of fields as charts. This is useful when the field contains an array of objects.
It works very similar to the chart-command, except that it is not applied to the main result but to the fields.
This command is often combined with aggregation commands (stats, statsmatrix, aggregate ...) that are using the aggregation function records().
</p>


<p>Following example makes a statsmatrix of ITEMS and BOX_SIZE, makes an array of records and renders them as a charts with series by "WAREHOUSE" and "CLASS".
Too hard to explain, just copy and paste below code and look for yourself.

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| meta BY = [ITEM]

	[(COUNT == null), "cfw-gray"] 
	[(COUNT &lt; 20), "cfw-red"] 
	[(COUNT &lt; 40), "cfw-orange"]  
	[(COUNT &lt; 60), "cfw-yellow"] 
	[(COUNT &lt; 80), "cfw-limegreen"] 
	[true, "cfw-green"]
