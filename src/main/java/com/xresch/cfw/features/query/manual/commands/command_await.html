<p>This command waits until all records have been processed before giving them to the next command.</p>

<p>Here is an example that counts the total number of records using the await-command (this can also be achieved using the aggregate-command):</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records = 1000
| each globals(TOTAL, count()+1)
| await
| set TOTAL = g(TOTAL)</code></pre>
