<p>This command is used to merge two or more results of multiple queries into one.</p>

<p>Following example executes 3 queries and then merges the result into one:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=1
;
| source random records=2
;
| source random records=4
; 
| merge</code></pre>

<p>You can as well name the results using the metadata command, and only merge specific results:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| metadata name = "Result One"
| source random records=10
;
| metadata name = "Result Two"
| source random records=20
;
| metadata name = "Result Three"
| source random records=30
;
| metadata name = "Merged 1&amp;3"
| merge "Result One", "Result Three"</code></pre>


<p>You can use merge inside another query to append results.
Following executes two queries, then executes a third one and appends the results of 'Result One' to it:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| metadata name = "Result One"
| source random records=10
;
| metadata name = "Result Two"
| source random records=20
;
| metadata name = "Result One and Three"
| source random records=30
| merge "Result One"</code></pre>
