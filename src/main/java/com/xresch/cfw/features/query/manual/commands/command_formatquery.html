<p>Creates a new field which contains a button that executes a query when clicked. The results will be shown in a modal panel.
The modal panel will have a query editor and the result below it. With this you can adjust the query as needed.
This is one way to get more details for your data. In case you want to display the data directly in the main result, you can use the subquery function.
</p>


<h3>Minimal Example</h3>
<p>Following is a minimal example on how to create a box plot. In this case we only get a simple box and the result ends up looking like a gantt chart: </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random
| formatquery
	query = `| source random records=1000 | filter FIRSTNAME == '`+FIRSTNAME+`' `
</code></pre>


<h3>Advanced Example</h3>
<p>Following is a more advanced example that customizes the fieldame, the button and the title of the modal panel: </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random
| formatquery
	field = "Details"
	label = "More"
	icon = "fa-plus-square"
	title = "Show all with name " + FIRSTNAME
	query = 
`| source random records=1000
| filter 
	FIRSTNAME == '`+FIRSTNAME+`'
	LIKES_TIRAMISU == true
| formatrecord 	
	[(VALUE == null), "cfw-gray"] 
	[(VALUE &lt; 70), "cfw-green"] 
	[(VALUE  &lt; 90), "cfw-orange"] 
	[true, "cfw-red"] 
| display as = properties`
| display as=table</code></pre>


<h3>Multiple Queries</h3>
<p>You can use multiple formatquery commands to give different options to your users. For example, 
the following gives the possibilities to filter by name and display data as a chart:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random

| formatquery
	field = "Filter"
	icon = "fa-filter"
	title = "Show all with name " + FIRSTNAME
	query = 
`| source random records=1000
| filter FIRSTNAME == '`+FIRSTNAME+`'
| display as = properties`

| formatquery
	field = "Chart"
	icon = "fa-chart-area"
	title = "Statistics for "+ FIRSTNAME
	query = 
`| source random records=100 type="stats" seriesCount = 1
| chart 
	type = line
	x = TIME 
	y = [MIN, AVG, P90, MAX]
	tension = 0.4 # 0 to 1, makes lines smoother
	height='50vh'
	pointradius=2`
	
| display as=table</code></pre>
