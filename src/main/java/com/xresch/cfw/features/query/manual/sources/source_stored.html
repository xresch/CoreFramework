	The stored source let's you execute a query that you have stored and retrieve it's output like with any other source.
	It will ignore the formatting you do in the stored query, it only takes the data. (have a look at the stored-command too)
	You can provide the parameters for the query as well. The query store makes it easy to make templates
	of often used queries, standardize them and make it easier to maintain them centralized.
</p>

<h3>Basic Example</h3>
<p>Here is an example of a the stored source executing a query.
The easiest way to fill the query parameter is to use Ctrl + Space to get content-assist:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source stored
	query = {"id":123,"name":"My Stored Query"} </code></pre>

<h3>Using Parameters</h3>
<p>When you store your query, store it with a paramdefaults command. First, by doing so, you will 
document what are the actual parameters usable in that query.
Second, when you use Ctrl + Space for content assist, you will get the list of parameters as well.
For example, lets say we have the following stored query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| paramdefaults
	records = 888 			# three times infinity
	tiramisu = true 		/* filter by dessert */
	name_filter = "Aurora" 	# Flashy Name
	"multiline" = `
		test
		bla
		blub
	`  /*
		multiline
		comment
		*/
| source random records = p(records)
| filter
	LIKES_TIRAMISU == p(tiramisu)
	FIRSTNAME == p(name_filter)</code></pre>

<p>Now when we use the Ctrl + Space and choose the query, the default parameters are filled in as well.
The output will look like follows. The comments are included too, what gives you an easy way to help whoever will use the stored query.
Any parameter is optional, if not defined, the default value is used.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source stored
	query = {"id":88,"name":"Query With Parameters"} 
	params = object(
		  "records", 888 			# three times infinity
		, "tiramisu", true 		/* filter by dessert */
		, "name_filter", "Aurora" 	# Flashy Name
		, "multiline", `
		test
		bla
		blub
	`  /*
		multiline
		comment
		*/
	)</code></pre>
