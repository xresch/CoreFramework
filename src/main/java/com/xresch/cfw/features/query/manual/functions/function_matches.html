<p>This function checks if a string matches a given regular expression.
The regex will have to match the full string, therefore you would in many cases need to include ".*" at the beginning and end of the regex.</p>

<p>Following query creates example records and uses the matches function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random 
| keep VALUE, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME
| set
	ALWAYS_FALSE = matches(LASTNAME, "[s]") # doesn't work as regex must match full string
	MATCH = matches(LASTNAME, ".*[s].*") # matches if LASTNAME contains s</code></pre>
