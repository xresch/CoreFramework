<p>This function is used to calculate Pearson's Correlation Coefficient for two values. 
It supports aggregation and can be used in aggregation commands.</p>

<p>Following is an example on how to use this function in aggregation command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| meta 
	BY = ["WAREHOUSE", "ITEM"]
| source random 
	type=series 
	seriesCount=3
| stats 
	by		= meta(BY)
	PRICE 	= avg(PRICE)
	BOX_SIZE= avg(BOX_SIZE)
	TOTAL 	= avg(TOTAL)
	"CORR" 	= corr(TOTAL, BOX_SIZE)</code></pre>

<p>If you have your values in arrays(stored in fields), you can as well use the correlation function directly on those arrays:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random 
| keep FIRSTNAME
| set correlation = corr( [1,2,3,4,5] , [5,4,3,2,1] )</code></pre>


<p>If you want to visualize correlation as a chart instead, here is an example how to do that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| meta 
	BY = ["WAREHOUSE", "ITEM"]
| source random type=series seriesCount=3
| chart 
	by		= meta(BY)
	type	= scatter
	x		= TOTAL
	y		= BOX_SIZE
	height	= "400px"
	width	= "400px"
	xtype	= linear
	xlabel	= "Total Price"
	ylabel	= "Box Size"
	pointradius = 2
</code></pre>
