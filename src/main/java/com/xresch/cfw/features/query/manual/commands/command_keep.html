<p>Keep is used to only keep the fields you want to display in the results. 
It is helpful to reduce execution time and resource usage. It is also used to change the order of the fields.</p>

<p>Following code will create 1000 random records, and only keep the five specified fields:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random
| keep INDEX, TIME, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, VALUE</code></pre>



<p>If you have a lot of fields, and you just want to move a few at the start, you can combine this command with the fields-function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random
| keep LIKES_TIRAMISU LOCATION  fields(LIKES_TIRAMISU, LOCATION) </code></pre>
