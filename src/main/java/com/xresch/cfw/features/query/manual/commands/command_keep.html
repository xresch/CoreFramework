<p>Keep is used to only keep the fields you want to display in the results. 
It is helpful to reduce execution time and resource usage. It is also used to change the order of the fields.</p>

<p>Following code will create 1000 random records, and only keep the five specified fields:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random
| keep INDEX, TIME, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, VALUE</code></pre>


<p>If you want to move around fields, use the move command instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random 
| move before=ID LIKES_TIRAMISU</code></pre>
