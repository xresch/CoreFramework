<p>Distinct will filter the records by the values of the chosen fields. 
It will only keep the first record that has a certain value. 
Every following record with the same value will be removed. </p>

<p>Following code will create 5000 random records and deduplicates them by FIRSTNAME:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">source random records=5000
| distinct FIRSTNAME</code></pre>


<p>Will remove duplicates based on a combination of LASTNAME and LIKES_TIRAMISU:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">source random records=5000
| distinct LASTNAME, LIKES_TIRAMISU</code></pre>


<p>By default, whitespaces are removed from the beginning and end of the values, if you want to keep the whitespaces you can set the trim parameter to false:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">source random records=5000
| distinct trim=false LASTNAME, LIKES_TIRAMISU</code></pre>
