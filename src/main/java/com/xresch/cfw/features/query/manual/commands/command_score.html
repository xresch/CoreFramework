<p>The score command can be used to calculate a score based on multiple weighted evaluations.
The scores are specified like:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery"># name: is the name of the score
# weight: the importance relative to other scores
# scoreValue: the value for the score
name = [weight, scoreValue] 

# example
'myScore' = [ 1.0, if( (VALUE > 50), 100, 0) ]</code></pre>



<p>The final score of a record is calculated by having a sum of all weighted scores (score * weight) divided by the sum of all weights.
Here is some pseudo code to demonstrate what is calculated by this command:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">foreach(scoreRule) {
	sumWeights += scoreRule.weight;
	sumWeightedScores += (scoreRule.value * scoreRule.weight);
}
totalScore = sumWeightedScores / sumWeights;
</code></pre>



<p>In following example, the score will be 82, as the score 'two' has a much higher weight than 'one' ( 410 / 5.0 = 82 ): </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source empty
| score
	'one' 	= [ 1.0, 10]
	'two'	= [ 4.0, 100 ]
| formatfield
	scoredetails = ['list', "bullets", "10px", false]</code></pre>



<p>The following is a more extensive example on how you can use the score command:.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| record
	[GROUP, VALUE] 
	['A', 100]
	['A', 50]
	['B', 50]
	['XXX', 999] # other group between 'B' to show that prev() works grouped
	['B', 100]
| score
	by=[GROUP]
	scorefield="SCORE"
	detailsfield="DETAILS"
	'simple'= [ 1, VALUE ]
	'calc' 	= [ 2.0, VALUE-50 ]
	'if'	= [ 1.0, if(VALUE > 50, 100, 0) ]
	'prev' 	= [ 0.5, if( prev(VALUE) &lt; VALUE, 100, 0)  ]
	'case' 	= [ 3.5
			  , case(
			  		VALUE >= 90
			  			, 100
			  	  , VALUE >= 80
			  	 		, 90
			  	  , VALUE >= 50
			  	 		, 75
			  	  , true
			  	 		, 0
			  	) 
			]
| formatfield
	SCORE = ['align', 'right']
	SCORE = ['postfix', ' %']
	DETAILS = ['list', "bullets", "10px", false]</code></pre>
