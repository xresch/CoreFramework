<p class="bg-danger" >WARNING: Subqueries can have a heavy performance impact on the application, use with caution.</p>

<p>Executes a query and returns the results as an array.
This function is useful to fetch additional data from another source for each record.</p>


<p>Following query executes a subquery to get a simulated IS_BUSY status for each person:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=10
| keep FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME
| set 
	# lets simulate a call to another datasource that returns a single value as the result
	BUSY_BUSY = subquery("
		| source empty
		| set IS_BUSY=randomFrom([true, false])
		| keep IS_BUSY
		") </code></pre>

<p>Above subquery()-executions will return all the results as a value(like 'true'), as there is only a single record and only one column.
This might lead to issues when you need a consistent data format. Therefore two additional parameters  doUnpack and doSimplify are provided so you can turn of this behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=10
| keep FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME
| set 
	UTTERLY_BUSY = subquery("
		| source empty
		| set IS_BUSY=randomFrom([true, false])
		| keep IS_BUSY
		", false, false) # if only one result, do not unpack the array and do not convert object to value</code></pre>
		
	
<p>If you have multiple records in your subquery results, you can use unbox to convert them to fields of your main query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=100
| keep FIRSTNAME, VALUE
| set
	DETAILS = subquery("
		| source random type=various records=50
		| distinct FRUIT, COLOR
		| keep FRUIT, COLOR
		| top "+random(1,3)+" # limit to 3
	", false, false)
| unbox DETAILS # unbox array, create additional records for every entry
| unbox DETAILS # unbox object create additional records for every object member
| remove DETAILS # remove the details field</code></pre>
