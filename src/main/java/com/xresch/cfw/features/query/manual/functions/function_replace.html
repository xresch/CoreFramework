<p>Use this function whenever you need to replace something in a string.</p>

<p>Following query creates example records and does various sample replace operations:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random 
| keep VALUE, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, LOCATION, URL, LIKES_TIRAMISU
| set
	# no parameters will result in null
	DEFAULT = replace()
	# only one parameter will return the same value
	FIRSTNAME_A = replace(FIRSTNAME)
	# if no replacement is provided the occurences will be removed from the string
	LASTNAME_A = replace(LASTNAME, "son")
	# replacement will replace all the occurences of the searched string
	URL = replace(URL, "example", "yayalot")
	# if more than one thing has to be replaced just use the function again
	URL = replace(URL, "mightyperson", "royalbeing")
	# booleans and number inputs will be treated as string
	BOOL = replace(LIKES_TIRAMISU, "true", "maybe")
	NUMBER = replace(VALUE, "8", "-eight-")</code></pre>
