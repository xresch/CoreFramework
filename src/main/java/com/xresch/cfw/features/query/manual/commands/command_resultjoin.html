<p>This command is used to join two results together. This works in a similar way is with SQL joins.
This can become very handy if you cannot use SQL joins. 
For example, if you want to join data from different data sources.
</p>

<p>Following example maps categories to records using an inner join:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| globals
	multidisplay=3
| record
	[ID, CATEGORY]
	[1, "A"]
	#[2, "B"]
	#[3, "C"]
	[4, "D"]
	[5, "E"]
;
| source random records = 1000
| keep FIRSTNAME
| set CATEGORY_ID = randomfrom([3,4,5])
;
| meta title=true name="testabc" 
| resultjoin
	on=(ID == CATEGORY_ID)
	join="inner"</code></pre>
	
	
<p>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| globals
	multidisplay=3
| source random records = 1000
| keep INDEX, FIRSTNAME, LIKES_TIRAMISU
;
| source random records = 1000
| keep INDEX, LASTNAME, LIKES_TIRAMISU
| filter (INDEX % 2) == 0
;
| meta title=true name="Joined Result" 
| resultjoin
	on=(
		INDEX == INDEX 
		AND LIKES_TIRAMISU == LIKES_TIRAMISU
	)</code></pre>
