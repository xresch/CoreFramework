<p>
	The threaddump source creates a thread dump of the current application instance and returns a record for each stacktrace element.
	<br>The BLOCKING_THREAD field will be -1 if there is no other thread blocking the current one.
</p>

<p>An example query that creates count statistics by stacktrace element name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source threaddump 
| stats by=[STACK_ELEMENT] COUNT=count()
| sort COUNT reverse=true</code></pre>
