<p>This function returns the duration of the selected timeframe. T
This function was introduced as some API calls are easier created by providing an offset in the size of the duration, 
instead of making an offset of the whole timeframe used by the query and making a second call.
</p>

<p>Following query uses the function to get the duration in various time units:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source empty
| set
	seconds = timeframeDuration('s') + "s"
	minutes = timeframeDuration('m') + "m"
	hours = timeframeDuration('h') + "h"</code></pre>

<p>This function ignores fractions and always returns integer values that are rounded down. 
If after rounding the value is 0, the function will return 1 to at least have a duration.
If you select a time unit that is far bigger than your selected timeframe, this might lead to unwanted behaviour.
For example, if you select a timeframe with a duration of 1 hour, and you request a duration in years, the function will return 1 year:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source empty
| set
	# will result in "1y"
	years= timeframeDuration('y') + "y"</code></pre>
