<p>This function manipulates the selected earliest and later time. 
It's main use is to select a second timeframe based on the current timeframe to get data for comparison purposes:</p>

<p>Following query uses the function to offset the timeframe for a second query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| globals multidisplay=2
| source random records = 10
| keep TIME
;
# offset the selected timeframe earliest/latest into the past one time
# e.g. if the selected timeframe is 2 days, will shift the previous two days
| execute timeframeoffset(-1) 
| source random records = 10
| keep TIME</code></pre>


<p>You can use further offset parameters to specify the amounts to offset the timeframe.
Following will offset the timeframe by one day:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| globals multidisplay=2
| source random records = 10
| keep TIME
;
# offset earliest/latest by one day, alternatively you can use earliestSet() or latestSet()
| execute timeframeoffset(0,0,0,-1) 
| source random records = 10
| keep TIME</code></pre>
