<p>This function returns a previous value that was passed to the function. 
This is useful for comparing current record data to previous record data.
The offset can be defined with the second parameter, so you can as well get values further back.
By default, the function returns null if there are not yet enough values. This default value can be set with the third parameter. </p>


<p>Following query uses the prev function and does various calculations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random type=trading
| set
	PREV_CLOSE = prev(CLOSE) # get previous value
	PREV_PREV = prev(CLOSE, 2) # offset by 2, get value before previous value
	DEFAULT_ZERO = prev(CLOSE, 10, 0) # offset by 10, return 0 for the first 10 values
	
	INCREASED = (PREV_CLOSE &lt; CLOSE) # check has value increased
	
	# check has increased twice
	INCREASED_TWICE = (
				PREV_PREV &lt; PREV_CLOSE 
			AND PREV_CLOSE &lt; CLOSE
			) 
	
	# calculating is value up or down
	TREND = if( (PREV_CLOSE - CLOSE) == 0
			  , 0
			  , if( (PREV_CLOSE - CLOSE) &lt; 0, 1, -1 )
			)
			
	# Calculating time difference
	PREV_TIME = prev(TIME)
	TIME_DIFF = if(PREV_TIME == null, null, (TIME - PREV_TIME) )
