<p>This function allows you to trim away those whitespaces from the start and end of a string.</p>

<p>Following code will create random series data and trims white spaces that were added for no reason but having something to demonstrate:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=100 type=series
| set 
	# create string with leading and trailing white spaces
	WHITESPACES="   "+WAREHOUSE+" "+ITEM+"   "
	# make spaces visible with encode
	ENCODED=encode(WHITESPACES)
	# use trim to remove them
	TRIMMED=encode( trim(WHITESPACES) )</code></pre>
