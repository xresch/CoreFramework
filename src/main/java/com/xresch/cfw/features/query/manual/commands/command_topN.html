<p>This command returns only the first N records after sorting them by the value field.
It also allows to aggregate the remaining records into a single "Others" record</p>

<p>Following an example query that uses the command to create a doughnut chart:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random type="series" records = 100 seriesCount=20
| stats #reduce data points to timegroup
	by=[ITEM] 
	"COUNT"	= sum("COUNT")
| topN
	n=5
	value="COUNT"
	label="ITEM"
	others = true
| chart 
	by = "ITEM"
	y= "COUNT"
	type= "doughnut"
	height = "400px"
	legendpos = left</code></pre>
