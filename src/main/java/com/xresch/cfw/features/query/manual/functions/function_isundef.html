<p>This function will return true only if the specified fieldname is undefined for the record.
This is different than checking for null, as null is assigned to a fieldname.</p>

<p>The following query creates sample records and show some uses of the iUndef-function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| record
	[NAME, VALUE]
	["Aurora", 42]
	["Treya"]
	["Marion", "Panna Cotta"]
	["Alejandra"]
	[null, null]
| set eval = isUndef(VALUE) </code></pre>
