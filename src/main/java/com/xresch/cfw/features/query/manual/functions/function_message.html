<p>The message()-function lets you add messages to the response which will be displayed as toast messages in the browser.
The initial purpose for this function was for debugging values. The return value if this function is the message itself.
This allows you to wrap any value in your query and get it displayed on the screen for debugging.
Another thing that is useful to know in this regard, is that you can view disappeared messages in the browser by pressing Ctry + Alt + I.</p>



<p>Here a simple example where the message()-function is used to display the each-value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random
	each = [1, 2, 3]
	records = message(sourceEach())</code></pre>



<p>With the second parameter you can specify the message type, 
what is useful to make distinctions if you have multiple instances of message().
The same message will only be printed once, so if you have two SUCCESS-messages saying "true" it will only be printed once. </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| paramdefaults OBJECT = {a: true}
| source random records = 2
| set
	A = message( "" + VALUE / 2.5, "INFO")
	B = message( round(sin(VALUE), 3) , "SUCCESS")
	C = message( [1,2,3], "WARNING")
	D = message( param(OBJECT).a , "ERROR")5</code></pre>
