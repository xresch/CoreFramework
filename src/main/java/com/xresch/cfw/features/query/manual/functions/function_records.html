<p>This function is used to create an array of records in aggregation function. 
This is useful in case you want to group records and format them in a table cell.
In most cases this function is combined with the displayfields and chartfields command.</p>

<p>Following is an example on how to use this function in aggregation commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery"># set metadata
| meta 
	BY = [WAREHOUSE, ITEM]
	HEIGHT = "50px"
	WIDTH = "25vw"

# create sample records
| source random records=100 type=series

# Add formats before aggregating
| formatrecord
	[(COUNT == null), "cfw-gray"] 
	[(COUNT &lt; 20), "cfw-red"] 
	[(COUNT &lt; 40), "cfw-orange"]  
	[(COUNT &lt; 60), "cfw-yellow"] 
	[(COUNT &lt; 80), "cfw-limegreen"] 
	[true, "cfw-green"] 
# Aggregate the records into multiple array
| stats
	by = meta(BY)
	"Status Bar" = records() # makes an array of the records
	"Count Chart" = records()
	"Price Chart" = records() 
	
| displayfields # format one records-array as status bar
	fields = "Status Bar" 
	as = statusbar
	height = meta(HEIGHT)
	width = meta(WIDTH)
	
| chartfields # format another records-array as a count chart
	fields = "Count Chart" 
	by = meta(BY)
	type = sparkarea
	x = TIME
	y = COUNT
	height = meta(HEIGHT)
	width = meta(WIDTH)
	
| chartfields  # format the last records-array as a price chart
	fields = "Price Chart" 
	by = meta(BY)
	type = sparkarea
	x = TIME
	y = PRICE
	height = meta(HEIGHT)
	width = meta(WIDTH)</code></pre>
	
<p>Following uses the records function outside of an aggregation context. This will just return a copy of the current record:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source json data=`
[
	 {index: 0, array: [1,2,3], object: {a: 0, b: 1, c: 3 } }
	,{index: 1, array: [1,null,3], object: {a: 11, b: 22, c: null} }
	,{index: 2, array: [null,null,3], object: {a: null, b: 22, c: null} }
	,{index: 3, array: [null,null,null], object: {a: null, b: null, c: null} }
	,{index: 3, array: [1,2,3, "StringsAndBooleans_ignored"], object: {a: 11, b: 22, c: 33, string: "ignored"} }
]
`
| set 
	# return number of items in array that are null
	record=records()</code></pre>
