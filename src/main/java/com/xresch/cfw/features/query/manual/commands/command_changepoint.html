<p>This command will do changepoint detection using a Sliding Window Change Detection Algorithm.
You can group the statistics by specific fields using the by-parameter.
Values should be sorted by time before using this command.
The window size used for the calculations will be half the defined period.
Results will be booleans, which can also be displayed with the chart command.
</p>

<p>The following changepoint example groups by WAREHOUSE AND ITEM and detects the change points in the data for each group:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| meta 
	BY = ["WAREHOUSE", "ITEM"]
| source random 
	type=series 
	seriesCount=2
	records=300
| sort TIME
| changepoint 
	by=meta(BY) 
	field="COUNT" 
	name="change" 
	period=12
	precision=3 
	sensitivity=1.5
| chart
	by= meta(BY)
	x=TIME
	y=[COUNT, 'change']
	ymin=null
	height="300"
	multichart=true</code></pre>
