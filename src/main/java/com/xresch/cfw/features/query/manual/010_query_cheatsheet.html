	This cheat sheet gives you a quick introduction to the concepts of the query language and how to use it.

<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

<!-- =========================== FIRST ROW ================================= -->
<div class="d-flex flex-row page-break-avoid">

	<div class="card flex-grow-1">
		<div class="card-header pt-1 pb-1">
			<div>Queries</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body maxvw-40">
			Queries are a combination of one or multiple commands chained together with the pipe "|" symbol.
			Multiple queries can be combined together by using semicolon ";" to terminate one query and start a new one. 
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="card flex-grow-1">
		<div class="card-header pt-1 pb-1">
			<div>Commands</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body maxvw-40">
			Commands are used to fetch and process data.
			The most important command is 'source', as it is the one bringing data into your query.
			Commands can have aliases, for example instead of 'source', you can as well use 'src'.
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="card flex-grow-1">
		<div class="card-header pt-1 pb-1">
			<div>Sources</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body maxvw-40">
			Sources are data provider from which the queries are getting their data.
			The 'source' command is used to choose one of these sources. For example 
			you can choose the source 'random' which will give you randomized test data:
			<pre><code>source random records=100</code></pre>
		</div>
	</div>
	
</div>


<!-- =========================== SECOND ROW ================================= -->

<div class="d-flex flex-row page-break-avoid">

	<div class="card flex-grow-1">
		<div class="card-header pt-1 pb-1">
			<div>In-Memory Processing</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body maxvw-40">
			All the data fetched by the query is processed in the memory and is returned to the client once all data is processed.
			Therefore queries can be memory intensive. Therefore there are limits on how many data can be processed.
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="card flex-grow-1">
		<div class="card-header pt-1 pb-1">
			<div>Limits</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body maxvw-40">
			The limits are set by the system administrator. 
			There is a default and maximum fetch limit on the number of records processed per source.
			You can change the default limit on the source command using the parameter 'limit':
			<pre><code>source random records=50000 limit=100000</code></pre>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="card flex-grow-1">
		<div class="card-header pt-1 pb-1">
			<div>CPU Intensive</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body maxvw-40">
			As commands are chained together and executed in parallel, as more commands a query has the more threads are started and as higher it's CPU usage.
		</div>
	</div>
	
</div>

<!-- =========================== THIRD ROW ================================= -->

<div class="d-flex flex-row page-break-avoid">

	<div class="card flex-grow-1">
		<div class="card-header pt-1 pb-1">
			<div>Record</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body maxvw-40">
			A set of data that relates to the same thing is considered a record.
			A record could be the personal data of a human being or the properties of a host.
			In the table view, a record is represented as a row of the table.
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="card flex-grow-1">
		<div class="card-header pt-1 pb-1">
			<div>Fields</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body maxvw-40">
			A field is a single property of a record.
			For example the firstname and lastname of a person are fields of a record.
			A field has a fieldname and a field value. Fieldnames are used in queries
			to select the fields to filter by or to which data should be manipulated.
			Fieldnames are case sensitive.
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="card flex-grow-1">
		<div class="card-header pt-1 pb-1">
			<div>Timerange</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body maxvw-40">
			A time range selector is available to specify the time to fetch data from the source.
			It depends on the source if time is actually used and how it is applied. Check the
			documentation for the  source you are using or use the content assist.
