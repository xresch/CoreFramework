<p>The file source is used to read data from files stored in the File Manager of this application. 
This can be useful to either analyze file content, or to manage certain data in a central place that you want to join or merge with other data. </p>

<h2>Autocomplete to Select Files</h2>
<p>This command supports autocomplete to assist you to select the files you have stored in the File Manager.
While your cursor is in the Query editor after "source file ", press Ctrl + Space to get a list of up to 50 files in the autocomplete. 
You can also filter by the filename and extension by doing the same after a word, for example searching for the file 'myHumongousFile.json' could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">########## List all JSON Files #################
| source file 
	json # your cursor here #
;
########## List all Files containing 'Humon' #################
| source file 
	Humon # your cursor here #
;
########## List all Files containing 'myHumongousFile.json' #################
# this needs to be put into quotes, as '.' is an operator in the query language 
| source file 
	"myHumongousFile.json" # your cursor here #
	  </code></pre>
	  
	
	
<h2>List of As-Options</h2>
<p>This source allows to parse the response of request in various ways, following a list of the available as-options(Default: json):</p>
{asOptionPlaceholder}



<h2>Parse As: Auto</h2>
<p>If the as-option is not specified, the query will try to use the best option available based on the file extension.
You can always set this manually if it doesn't work or if you want a different output format.
Here is a very simple example on how to read an xml-file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	file = {"id": 134, "name": "data.xml"}  </code></pre>



<h2>Parse As: CSV</h2>
<p>Here is a simple example on how to parse a CSV-file with a custom separator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	as = 'csv'
	file = {"id":66 , "name": "data.csv"} 
	separator=";"  </code></pre>



<h2>Parse As: JSON</h2>
<p>Following an example how to parse a JSON-file. 
It parses an exported EMP Dashboard file and uses the unbox-command to get the vidget data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	as = 'json'
	file = {"id": 20, "name":"EMP_Exported_Dashboard.json" } 
| unbox replace=true payload.dashboards[0].widgets
| unbox replace=true widgets</code></pre>	



<h2>Parse As: Excel</h2>
<p>Here an example how to parse data from an excel sheet. Blank rows and columns in the excel will be ignored:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	as = excel
	file = {"id":257,"name":"data.xlsx"}
	sheet = "data" # optional, default is first sheet 
	header = true # default, set to false if there is no header, or if you want to use the excel column names (A, B, C ...)</code></pre>	

	
<h2>Parse As: HTML</h2>
<p>Here is a simple example on how to parse a HTML-file with a custom separator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	as = 'html'
	file = {"id": 88, "name": "data.html"}</code></pre>	



<h2>Parse As: HTML and Extract Tables</h2>
<p>Using 'as=htmltables' will parse as HTML and extract all the tables from the response:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	as = "htmltables"
	file = {"id": 999999999, "name": "website.html"}
| filter 
	tableindex > 0
	length(data) > 0
| unbox data replace = true</code></pre>	



<h2>Parse As: XML</h2>
<p>Following is an example how to fetch data and parse the response as XML. The response will be a flat table containing all elements from the XML tree:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	as = 'xml'
	file = {"id": 134, "name": "data.xml"}</code></pre>	



<h2>Parse As: XML with Structure</h2>
<p>Using 'as=xmltree' will also parse as XML, but retains the tree structure of the elements.
Following example extracts records from an XML-Export and uses the unbox &amp; statsmatrix command to turn it into a table regular:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	as = 'xmltree'
	file = {"id": 134, "name": "data.xml"}
	/* Above data contained records like the following at some point in human history:
	&lt;data>
		&lt;record>
	   		&lt;firstname>Aurora&lt;/firstname>
	   		&lt;lastname>Testonia&lt;/lastname>
	   		&lt;country>Ireland&lt;/country>
	   		&lt;dessert withcream="true" creamWipped="yes please">Tiramisu&lt;/dessert>
		&lt;/record>
		  ... many more records ... 
	&lt;/data> 
	*/
| unbox replace = true children
| unbox replace = true children
| unbox replace = false children
| unbox replace = true 
		key # keep key
		children.tag
		children.text
		children.attributes
| statsmatrix 
	column = 'tag'
	row = 'key'
	value = first(text) # as there is anyway only one value for each key/tag combination
| sort key
| remove key</code></pre>	



<h2>Parse As: Lines</h2>
<p>Following is an example how to fetch data and parse each line of the file into a record.
This can be useful for plain text data and filtering for specific lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	as = 'lines'
	file = {"id":321,"name":"data.txt"}</code></pre>	



<h2>Parse As: Plain</h2>
<p>the plain parser will just take the whole content of the file and dump it into a single field.
The option has been exorcised to get rid of curses and evil spirits. It also has been blessed by supernatural existences.
This can be useful for displaying plain text file content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source file 
	as = 'plain'
	file = {"id": 666, "name": "haunted_houses.txt"}</code></pre>
