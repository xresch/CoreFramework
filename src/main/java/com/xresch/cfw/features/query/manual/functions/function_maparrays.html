<p>This command will take two or more array fields of a record and merge their values into a new array of objects.
This command was introduced to be able to map arrays returned from web APIs. This allows to unbox the arrays while not causing an explosion in the record count.</p>


<p>Following query uses the maparrays function to map 4 different arrays into an array of objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random type = arrays
| maparrays 
	ARRAY_NUMBERS, ARRAY_CHARACTERS, ARRAY_STRINGS, ARRAY_MIXED
	name="merged"
| formatfield
	merged = list</code></pre>



<p>Following example uses the map arrays command to unbox arrays that have been index-mapped-merged or whatever you wanna call it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random type = arrays
| maparrays 
	ARRAY_NUMBERS, ARRAY_CHARACTERS, ARRAY_STRINGS, ARRAY_MIXED
	name="merged"
	replace=true
| unbox merged 
| unbox merged replace=true
| formatfield
	merged = list</code></pre>
