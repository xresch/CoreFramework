<p>This function is used to count number of records matching specified conditions. It supports aggregation and can be used in aggregation commands.</p>

<p>Following is an example how to use this function in aggregation commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=1000
| stats by=[LIKES_TIRAMISU] 
	# whenever the condition is true, count + 1
	COUNT_BIG=countif( VALUE >= 50 )
	COUNT_SMALL=countif( VALUE &lt; 50 ) 
	COUNT_AURORA=countif( FIRSTNAME == "Aurora" ) 
	COUNT_HERA_BIG=countif( 
		FIRSTNAME == "Hera" 
		AND VALUE >= 50
	)
	COUNT_HERA_SMALL=countif( 
		FIRSTNAME == "Hera" 
		AND VALUE &lt; 50
	)
| sort COUNT reverse=true</code></pre>


<p>Following query creates random records and uses the countif-function. 
The count will be increased on records where the condition is met.
This can be useful for time based data to find out 'how many records up to this point have met the condition?'.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=1000
| set 
	#return a number that increases by 1 every call
	COUNT_ALL=countif(true)
	# return number that increase every time condition is true
	COUNT_NUMBERS=countif(VALUE > 50)
</code></pre>
