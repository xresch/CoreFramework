<p>The globals command is used to add custom properties to all queries query. These global properties are case sensitive.</p>

<p>The following globals will fulfill specific functions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>multidisplay:&nbsp;</b> Number of columns used when displaying the results of multiple queries. Value must be between 1 and 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following example has 3 different queries separated by semicolon. The first query sets two globals and fetches some random data.
The query shows also the difference between globals and metadata command. Each query sets the query specific metadata property 'name' to change the title of the query. </p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| globals 
	multidisplay=3 
	myArray = ["A", "B", "C"] #used to set a custom parameter
	keepFields = [CUSTOM, VALUE] 
| metadata name="Aurora" | source random records=5 | set CUSTOM=randomFrom(globals(myArray)) | keep globals(keepFields)
;
| metadata name="Hera" | source random records=5 | set CUSTOM=randomFrom(globals(myArray)) | keep globals(keepFields)
;
| metadata name="Freia" | source random records=5  | set CUSTOM=randomFrom(globals(myArray)) | keep globals(keepFields)</code></pre>
