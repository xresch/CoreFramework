<p>The literal function is used to make sure you receive the string and not the value of a field with that fieldname.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=123 
| keep FIRSTNAME
| set
	FIELDVALUE = "FIRSTNAME" # returns the value of the field "FIELDNAME"
	LITERAL = literal("FIRSTNAME") #returns the string "FIRSTNAME" </code></pre>
