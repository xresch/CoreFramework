	The text source takes plain text input and converts it into records.
	By default it splits the text by the newline character '\n'.
</p>

<p>An example query that makes every line of a query into a record:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source text 
	text="
This will be a record.
And this another record.
Because it was so fantastic, makes this third line into a third record.
	"</code></pre>

<p>Here a more sophisticated example, with custom separator '\s' that splits by white spaces, removes special characters and creates a count by word:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source text 
	separator="\s"
	text="
This sentence contains an apple.
This sentence contains another apple.
This sentence should consider containing an apple.
Why the hell is there no tiramisu!?
	"
| set
	part=replace(part, ".", "")
	part=replace(part, "?", "")
	part=replace(part, "!", "")
| stats
	by=part
	count=count()
| sort count reverse=true</code></pre>


<p>Following query splits by newline, keeps empty lines an uses the count parameter to count number of T's n each line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source text 
	count="[T|t]"
	empty=true
	text="
	This is a Test.
Will it split?
Also lets count T!
Count those T's and t's: TtTtTtTt
	"</code></pre>
