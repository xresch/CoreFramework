<p>Filters fields based on the conditions you specify.</p>

<p>Following code will only keep records where the firstname is equals Athena: </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random
| filter FIRSTNAME==Athena</code></pre>


<p>This example keeps all records with firstname Venus and a lastname that matches the regex expression (ending with "son"). 
If you do not specify any of the keywords AND/OR, and is used implicitely to combine multiple conditions. </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=10000
| filter FIRSTNAME==Venus  LASTNAME~=".*son$"</code></pre>


<p>The following code shows an example of how to use the keywords AND, OR and NOT, as well as how to group conditions using braces.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=10000
    #only humans called 'Luna' or with a lastname that does not end with "son"
| filter (FIRSTNAME==Luna OR NOT LASTNAME~=".*son$") 
	# only people that like tiramisu
	NOT (LIKES_TIRAMISU==false)
	# only record where value is bigger than index
	NOT (VALUE / INDEX ) &lt;= 1</code></pre>


	
<p>You can as well use arithmetic expressions in the filter query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random type=numbers records=100000 limit=100000
| filter 
	_source~="^ra.*"+"dom" 
	AND (THOUSANDS >= 1000^3 AND FLOAT >= (1000^2)*9 ) 
	OR (BIG_DECIMAL>=700000 AND BIG_DECIMAL&lt;800000 ) 
| formatfield 
	[THOUSANDS,FLOAT,BIG_DECIMAL]=separators
	[THOUSANDS,FLOAT,BIG_DECIMAL]=['threshold', 0, 1000, 1000^2, 1000^3, (1000^4)*500, "text"]</code></pre>
