<p>This command lets you define how values of fields should be rendered. This is useful when the field contains an array of objects.
It works very similar to the display-command, except that it is not applied to the main result but to the fields.
This command is often combined with aggregation commands (stats, statsmatrix, aggregate ...) that are using the aggregation function records().
</p>


<p>Following example makes a statsmatrix of ITEMS and CLASSES, makes an array of records and shows them in traffic lights style.
Too hard to explain, just copy and paste below code and look for yourself.

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| meta BY = [ITEM]
| source random records=100 type=series
| formatrecord
	[(COUNT == null), "cfw-gray"] 
	[(COUNT &lt; 20), "cfw-red"] 
	[(COUNT &lt; 40), "cfw-orange"]  
	[(COUNT &lt; 60), "cfw-yellow"] 
	[(COUNT &lt; 80), "cfw-limegreen"] 
	[true, "cfw-green"] 
| statsmatrix 
	column=CLASS
	row=meta(BY)
	records=records() # makes an array of the whole records
| displayfields
	fields=fields(meta(BY)) # All fields except BY fields
	as=tileandbar
	visiblefields=[FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME]

	#width="100px"</code></pre>
