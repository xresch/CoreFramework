<p>This function splits values as a string with a regex delimiter. If there is nothing between two delimiters, an empty string will be added to the resulting array.</p>

<p>Following query creates example records and does various sample split-operations:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random 
| keep VALUE, LOCATION, URL, LIKES_TIRAMISU
| set VALUE = round( VALUE * randomFloat(), 3)
| set 
	# no parameters will result in null
	DEFAULT = split()
	# will return the value wrapped in an array
	SPLIT_NONE = split(LOCATION)
	# Split by blanks
	SPLIT_LOC = split(LOCATION, " ")
	# Splits by regular expression, in this case by dots "." and slashes "/"
	SPLIT_URL = split(URL, "[./]")
	# booleans and number inputs will be treated as string
	BOOL = split(LIKES_TIRAMISU, "u")
	NUMBER = split(VALUE, "[.]")</code></pre>
