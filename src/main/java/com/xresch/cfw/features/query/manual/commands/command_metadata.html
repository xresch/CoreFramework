<p>The metadata command is used to add custom properties to a query.</p>

<p>The following properties will also be used by the query engine itself:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>name:&nbsp;</b> Will be used as title on the user interface.</li>
	<li><b>description:&nbsp;</b> Will be used as a description on the user interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following code has two queries and adds the properties name and description to each query. The name property will also be used in the user interface for the title of the query. </p>

<pre><code>| metadata name="Random Records" description="Query creates random records." custom="whatever you wanna say."
| source random
;
| metadata name="More Randomness" description="just another example query"
| source random</code></pre>
