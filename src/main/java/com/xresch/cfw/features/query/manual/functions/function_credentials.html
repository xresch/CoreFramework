<p>The credentials function is used to retrieve credentials from the list of credentials(Menu &gt;&gt; Tools &gt;&gt; Credentials).
The credentials with the name must exists and you must have access to the credentials for successful saving and manual execution of the query.
</p>

<p>Here is a simple example that reads credentials and gets the account and password: </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source empty
| global CREDS = credentials( "myCreds" )
| set
	credentials = g(CREDS) # object with fields
	account = g(CREDS).account # get account
	password = g(CREDS).password # get password</code></pre>



<p>While the query is parsed, the parser checks if the users has the required permissions to use the selected credentials.
Therefore it is not possible to use dynamic parameters like &quot;credentials( meta(CREDS) )&quot;. This would give you an error like: </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery"> function credentials(): For security reasons, parameter must be a static value and cannot be dynamic. </code></pre>

<p>To still be able to make it dynamic on a dashboard, you can use a parameter-placeholder as follows: </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source empty
| global CREDS = $environment$ # the parameter environment would be a string like  "credentials('myCreds_PROD')"
| set
	credentials = g(CREDS)</code></pre>




<p>Special cases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=10
| set
    # Following returns an object containing the credentials, or:
	#   >> error: if no credentials with the given name exist in the DB
	#   >> error: if the user has no access to the credentials, occurs 
	#      on save or manual execution, not checked in automatic execution
	#      like by a dashboard widget
	credentials = credentials("Bla")
	# Following returns null 
	noParams = credentials() 	 	
	# noDynamic = credentials(meta("name"))  # error: function param cannot be dynamic
| formatfield 
	credentials = list</code></pre>
