<p>The credentials function is used to retrieve credentials from the list of credentials(Menu &gt;&gt; Tools &gt;&gt; Credentials).
The credentials with the name must exists and you must have access to the credentials for successful saving and manual execution of the query.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records=10
| meta name = "Bla"
| set
    # Following returns an object containing the credentials, or:
	#   >> error: if no credentials with the given name exist in the DB
	#   >> error: if the user has no access to the credentials, occurs 
	#      on save or manual execution, not checked in automatic execution
	#      like by a dashboard widget
	credentials = credentials("Bla")
	# Following returns null 
	noParams = credentials() 	 	
	# noDynamic = credentials(meta("name"))  # error: function param cannot be dynamic
| formatfield 
	credentials = list</code></pre>
