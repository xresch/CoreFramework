<p>The if-command is used to start and if-statement and introduce flow control into your query.
When using if-command, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Ending with End:&nbsp;</b>All if-statements have to be ended with the end-command. </li>
	<li><b>Order Unpredictable:&nbsp;</b>The order of the records after an if-statement cannot be predicted, even if most of the times it might look as having a specific order.</li>
	<li><b>Unworkable Combinations:&nbsp;</b>Certain commands will not work well with the if commands, as they do not work based on records. For example the commands formatfield, display and globals.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records = 20
| if (VALUE &lt; 50)
	| set SIZE = "Small"
| end
| sort VALUE</code></pre>



<p>Example with an else statement:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records = 20
| if (VALUE &lt; 50)
	| set SIZE = "Small"
| else
	| set SIZE = "Big"	
| end
| formatfield
	SIZE = ['case' 
				, "==Small", "cfw-green"
				, [], "cfw-red"
		   ]
| sort VALUE</code></pre>


<p>Here a bit more complex example with nested if-statements and bigger conditions:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source random records = 20
| if (
		VALUE &lt; 33 
		AND ( 1 == 1 OR length("1234") == 4) 
	)
	| if (LIKES_TIRAMISU == true)
		| set SIZE = "Small"
	| else
		| set SIZE = "-"
	| end
	| set NEW_FIELD = "123456"
	
| else (VALUE &lt; 66 AND null == null )
	| set SIZE = "Medium"
	
| else
	| set SIZE = "Big"
		
| end
| formatfield
	SIZE = ['case' 
			, "==Small", "cfw-green"
			, "==Medium", "cfw-orange"
			, "==Big", "cfw-red"
			, [], ""
			]
| sort VALUE</code></pre>
