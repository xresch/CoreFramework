<p>This command lets you adjust how the values of fields are displayed. 
There are various formatters that you can find in the section Available Formatters.
If you want to highly customize your display, use the 'css' formatter.
</p>

<p>The following query adds a dollar sign to the VALUE field. </p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">| source random 
| formatfield VALUE=[postfix," $"]</code></pre>

<p>You can define multiple formatters for the same field. That will stack on top of each other. Be aware that some might cancel each other out. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">| source random
| formatfield INDEX=align,right
	VALUE=[prefix,"Mighty Balance: "]
	VALUE=[postfix," $"]
	VALUE=[threshold,0,10,20,30,40]
	VALUE=align,center</code></pre>


<p>Further there are tree different styles how you can define the formatter: </p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Just the name, will use the default values for parameters
VALUE=threshold
# An array where first element is the formatter name and every other is a parameter
VALUE=[threshold,0,10,20,30,40]
# As a list, same as array except without square braces
VALUE=threshold,0,10,20,30,40</code></pre>
