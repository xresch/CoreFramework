<p>Following query uses the function to do various offsets of time:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">| source empty
| set
	now =timeoffset() # returns epoch milliseconds of present time 
	oneYear = timeoffset(null, 1) #takes current time and offsets it by +1 year
	oneMonth = timeoffset($latest$, 0, -1) #takes latest time and and offsets it by -1 month
	oneDay = timeoffset($earliest$, 0, 0, -1) #takes earliest time and and offsets it by -1 day
	oneHour = timeoffset($earliest$, 0, 0, 0, -1) #takes earliest time and and offsets it by -1 hour
	oneMinute = timeoffset($earliest$, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1) #takes earliest time and and offsets it by -1 day
	oneSecond = timeoffset($earliest$, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1) #takes earliest time and and offsets it by -1 second
	fiftyMilli = timeoffset($earliest$, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -50) #takes earliest time and and offsets it by -1 millisecond

	[oneHour, oneMinute, oneSecond, fiftyMilli] = ['timestamp', "HH:mm:ss.SSS"]</code></pre>
