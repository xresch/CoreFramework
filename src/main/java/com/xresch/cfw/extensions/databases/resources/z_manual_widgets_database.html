<p>
There are  widgets available for various databases:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>MySQL</strong></li>
	<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></li>
	<li><strong>MSSQL</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Oracle</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Generic JDBC:&nbsp;</strong>For any other database type for which a JDBC driver is available. 
	            Copy the drivers jar-File to the {APP_ROOT}/extensions(and it's dependencies, if any) and restart the application to be able to use the driver.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before the database widgets can be used, at least one database environment for the respective database type has to be defined by a user with admin permissions.
The environments can be added under &quot;Admin &gt;&gt; Context Settings&quot;.
</p>

<h3>Status Widgets: Alerting Task</h3>
<p>
All the database status widgets support an alerting task. To define such a task, edit the widget and change to the tab "Task Settings".
There you can define a task which will executed periodically in the background, evaluating thresholds based on the settings defined for this specific widget.
Will send an alert then the selected threshold is reached.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> There are as well separate job tasks available to do alerting based on database queries. In case you do not want to alerting without a widget.</p>
