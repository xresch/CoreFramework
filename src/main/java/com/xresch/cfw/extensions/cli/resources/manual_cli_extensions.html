<p>
The CLI Extensions adds features which allow you to execute commands on the command line interface of the application server.
</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>
To be able to use the features provided by the this extension, a user needs the permission 'CLI Extensions'.
</p>

<h2>Command Line Privileges</h2>
<p>The commands will be executed with the application user and therefore use the same privileges. 
If executions fail because of access denied or similar issues, an administrator might have to grant the user additional rights.
This might highly depend on your admin's mood. To increase the chances for success, it is suggested to invite for an Italian Tiramisu (or two)
before the asking for more privileges takes place.
</p>

<h2>Query Source</h2>
<p>
A query source "cli" is provided by this feature, which allows you to parse the output of CLI commands and manipulate them with other commands.
See the source manual for more information >> <a href="#" onclick="cfw_manual_loadPage('Query|Sources|cli');">source cli</a>
</p>

<h2>Dashboard Widgets</h2>
<p>
The dashboard widgets can be used to execute and show CLI output directly on a dashboard. 
For more information about the settings of the widgets, hover over the small info icon next to the respective setting.
See the widget manual for more information >> <a href="#" onclick="cfw_manual_loadPage('Dashboard|Widgets|Command Line|CLI Results');">Widget: CLI Result</a>

<h2>How to use the CLI Extensions</h2>


<h3>Executing Single Command</h3>
<p>Here are some very basic examples of how to execute a single command. For commands other than cmd and powershell on windows, 
you probably need to specify a fully qualified path or execute them with cmd/powershell.</p>

<p><b>CMD:</b></p>			<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">cmd /c dir</code></pre>
<p><b>Powershell:</b></p>	<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">powershell Get-ChildItem</code></pre>
<p><b>Git Bash:</b></p>		<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" -c "ls -la"</code></pre>
<p><b>Maven:</b></p>		<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">mvn.cmd install
#or...
cmd /c mvn install</code></pre>



<h3>Executing Piped Commands</h3>
<p>The engine that executes commands allows to pipe commands together. You might need to escape the pipe symbol if you want to pass a 
pipeline to a command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery"># Piping two commands together with the engine
cmd /c echo "hello world" > file.txt | cmd /c type file.txt
# Or with escaped pipe, use the pipe as is in the command line tool your are using
cmd /c echo "hello world" > file.txt \| type file.txt</code></pre>


<h3>Comments and Multiple Commands</h3>
<p>Each line starting with a # is considered a command. 
<br>You can execute multiple commands separated by newline. 
<br>You can escape the newline with '\'.
<br> Blank lines are ignored: 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">###################################
# Bash: Execute a command 
###################################
"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" -c "java -version"

###################################
# Bash: Execute a command with pipes
###################################
"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" -c "ps -ef | grep 'bash'"

###################################
# CMD: Execute a command
###################################
cmd /c mvn install
</code></pre>


<h3>Environment Variables</h3>
<p>The CLI extension will provide you with settings to add custom environment variables.
These will be added to the existing environment variables and enables you use them within your commands: </p>
<pre><code class="language-cfwquery">cmd /c echo %MY_VAR% %MY_MESSAGE%</code></pre>


<h3>Reading Head And Tail</h3>
<p>To only read the head and/or tail of an output, you can specify the number of lines to be read with the parameters 'Head' and 'Tail'.
The number of lines skipped will be added to the output like '[... 19 lines skipped ...]'. If you don't want that information 
you can turn it off by setting 'Count Skipped' to false. </p>
