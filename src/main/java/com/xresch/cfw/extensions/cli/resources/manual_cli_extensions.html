<p>
The CLI Extensions adds features which allow you to execute commands on the command line interface of the application server.
</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>
To be able to use the features provided by the this extension, a user needs the permission 'CLI Extensions'.
</p>

<h2>Command Line Privileges</h2>
<p>The commands will be executed with the application user and therefore use the same privileges. 
If executions fail because of access denied or similar issues, an administrator might have to grant the user additional rights.
This might highly depend on your admin's mood. To increase the chances for success, it is suggested to invite for an Italian Tiramisu (or two)
before the asking for more privileges takes place.
</p>

<h2>Query Source</h2>
<p>
A query source "cli" is provided by this feature, which allows you to parse the output of CLI commands and manipulate them with other commands.

For more information about the settings of the widgets, hover over the small info icon next to the respective setting.
