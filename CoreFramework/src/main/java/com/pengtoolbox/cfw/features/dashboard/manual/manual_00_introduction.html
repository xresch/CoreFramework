<p>
The Dashboard functionality in this application provides a simple way of displaying various data on a single screen. 
Dashboards are a good way to collect information that are needed on a regular basis. In this section of the manual
you will find the various out-of-the-box widgets and how to work with the dashboard. If the application provides 
additional widget, they might be documented in another section of this manual.
