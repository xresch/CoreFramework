<h2>Move Settings Window</h2>
<p>
You can move the settings window, by clicking and dragging the window. 
This will allow you to see the applied changes after saving, instead of closing the window when it covers the widget being edited.

<h2>Use Colors</h2>
<p>
The default settings of the widget provide the possibility to change the background and text colors of the widget.
If you want to group things together, using colors can be a good approach.
Here an overview of the colors you can choose from:

<h2>Resizing and Fitting a Dashboard on the Screen</h2>
<p>
To fit the dashboard on various screens, you can use the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Fullscreen Button:&nbsp;</b> Use the fullscreen button on the top right of the dashboard, to hide the upper part of the dashboard to save space. </li>
	<li><b>Browser Fullscreen(F11):&nbsp;</b> Make your browser display in fullscreen by hitting F11 on your keyboard or using the fullscreen option from the browser menu.</li>
	<li><b>Page Zoom:&nbsp;</b> Change the zoom factor of the page by using Ctrl+Mousewheel or changing the zoom in the browser menu. </li>
	<li><b>Combine:&nbsp;</b>Combine the above to create the view you need.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Add extra Space and use Height</h2>
<p>
When creating dashboards, it is a best practice to size a widget to consume a little extra space. This will prevent that you have to move around
a lot of widgets when you have to add more content and the content will fit the widget even when displayed on a small monitor.
Also because the dashboard sets the width of the widgets by percent and not absolute, it is a best practice to give a little extra height to
a widget to avoid scrollbars when displayed on other monitors.

<h2>Refresh Time</h2>
<p>
Add a refresh time widget for dashboards that are refreshed on a regular basis.
This will help you to see of what time the data actually is.
</p>


<h2>Hack: Multi Duplicate</h2>
<p>
If you need to duplicate a widget multiple times, you can use this hack that is not really a feature, but is possible because of how the UI reacts to 
this interaction. Left click on duplicate and drag it slightly away and release the mouse. This will duplicate the widget while keeping the popup
open and you can duplicate another time right away.
